This module provides common methods and wizards which can be useful to develop a connector between Odoo and a telephony system. It depends on the official module *phone_validation* which handle the reformatting of phone numbers using the `phonenumbers <https://github.com/daviddrysdale/python-phonenumbers>`_ Python library, which is a port of the library used in Android smartphones. For example, if
your user is linked to a French company and you update the form view of a
partner with a badly written French phone number such as '01-55-42-12-42',
Odoo will automatically update the phone number to `E.164 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164>`_ format '+33155421242'. This module extends this reformatting to create() and write() methods.

This module is used by the Odoo-Asterisk connector of the OCA.
