Installation
============

To use the Voicent connector, you need to install the
`Voicent-Python <https://pypi.org/project/Voicent-Python/>`_ library.

 pip install Voicent-Python

Usage
=====

#. Go to Connectors > Backends > Voicent Backends
#. Create a new Voicent Backend with the host, port, the caller ID and the number of lines
#. Create Call Lines to determine when (which stage in the process) calls are added to the queue
#. Create Contact Info to create the structure of the CSV file to send to Voicent
#. Create Replies to determine what to do based on the replies
#. Create Time Line to determine when (what time) calls are made

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* On the backend, replace the 'Applies On' selection list with a Many2one to ir.model.fields
* On the backend call line contact, use the domain widget to select the field
* Update the voicent library on Pypi with examples/voicent.py
