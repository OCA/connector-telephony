FreeSWITCH Click2dial CRM
=======================

This module adds CRM-specific features to the freeswitch_click2dial module.

It adds 2 features :

First, when you do a click2dial, OpenERP will propose you to create an
outbound phone call in the CRM ; if you answer 'Yes', it will create the phone
call in the CRM and open it in a new tab. If some users don't want to be asked
to create a phone call in the CRM each time they do a click2dial, you should
disable the corresponding option in the 'Telephony' tab of the 'User' form.

Second, when you receive a phone call and run the wizard
"Open calling partner", if the partner is found in OpenERP, you will see a
button that proposes to create an inbound phone call in the CRM.

This module has been initially developed by Zikzakmedia and has been
completely re-written by Akretion.

A detailed documentation for the OpenERP-FreeSWITCH connector is available on
the Akretion Web site :
