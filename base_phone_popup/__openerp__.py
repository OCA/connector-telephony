Base Phone Pop-up
=================

When the user receives a phone call, OpenERP can automatically open the
corresponding partner/lead/employee/... in a pop-up without any action from the
user.

The module *web_action_request* can be downloaded with Mercurial:

hg clone http://bitbucket.org/anybox/web_action_request

It depends on 2 other modules, *web_longpolling* and *web_socketio*, that can
be downloaded with this command:

hg clone http://bitbucket.org/anybox/web_socketio

You will find some hints in this documentation :
https://bitbucket.org/anybox/web_action_request

Warning : proxying WebSockets is only supported since Nginx 1.3.13 ; the
feature provided by this module won't work with older versions of Nginx.

TODO : document this new feature on the Akretion Web site :
